## ECG Paper
The standard paper speed is 25mm/sec:
-   1mm (_small square_) = 0.04 sec (40ms)
-   5mm (_large square_) = 0.2 sec (200ms)

At a paper speed of 25 mm/second

-   **1 small** square = 0.04 seconds
-   **5 small** squares = **1 large** square = 0.2 seconds
-   **5 large** squares = 1 second

_ECG rhythm strip:_
    -   = **250 small** squares = **50 large** squares = 10 seconds

## Rate calculation
To calculate _beats per minute_ (bpm):
    -   **1500 small** squares = **300 large** squares = 1 minute

1500/number of **small** squares between two R waves
300/number of **large** squares between two R waves
