**Branch of**: 

**Branches**: 
Upper arm: No branches

Forearm:
There are only two muscles of the anterior forearm that are not solely innervated by the median nerve: the *flexor carpi ulnaris* and *[[flexor digitorum profundus]]*. 
FCU -> receives sole innervation from the ulnar nerve and 
FDP -> receives dual innervation from both the median and [[ulnar nerve]]s.

Additionally, a branch of the median nerve, referred to as the “recurrent branch of the median nerve”, innervates the muscles of the thenar eminence of the hand. The thenar eminence contains the palm muscles at the base of the thumb. Thenar muscles enable thumb opposition, abduction and adduction. Distal branches of the median nerve also supply innervation to the lumbrical muscles located in the index and middle fingers.

	Pronator teres  
	Pronator quadratus  
	Flexor carpi radialis  
	Palmaris longus  
	Flexor digitorum superficialis  
	Flexor pollicis longus  
	Flexor digitorum profundus (only the radial half)

Distal forearm:
	Palmar cutaneous branch

**Nerve root values**: 

**Muscles innervated**: 
Motor supply (LOAF)  #mnemonic
-   Lateral 2 lumbricals
-   Opponens pollicis
-   Abductor pollicis brevis
-   Flexor pollicis brevis

**Cutaneous innervation**: 

**Actions**: 

## Lesions
Damage at wrist e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome
-   paralysis and wasting of thenar eminence muscles and opponens pollicis (ape hand deformity)
-   sensory loss to palmar aspect of lateral (radial) 2 ½ fingers

  
Damage at elbow: as above plus:  
-   unable to pronate forearm
-   weak wrist flexion
-   ulnar deviation of wrist

  
[[Anterior interosseous nerve]] (branch of median nerve): 
-   leaves just below the elbow
-   results in loss of pronation of forearm and weakness of long flexors of thumb and index finger
