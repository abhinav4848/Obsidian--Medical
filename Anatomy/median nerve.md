### Forearm:
There are only two muscles of the anterior forearm that are not solely innervated by the median nerve: the *flexor carpi ulnaris* and *[[flexor digitorum profundus]]*. 
FCU -> receives sole innervation from the ulnar nerve and 
FDP -> receives dual innervation from both the median and [[ulnar nerve]]s.

Additionally, a branch of the median nerve, referred to as the “recurrent branch of the median nerve”, innervates the muscles of the thenar eminence of the hand. 

### Distal forearm:
Palmar cutaneous branch

## Muscles innervated
Motor supply (LOAF)  #mnemonic
-   Lateral 2 lumbricals
-   Opponens pollicis
-   Abductor pollicis brevis
-   Flexor pollicis brevis

## Cutaneous innervation

## Actions: 

## Lesions
**Damage at wrist** e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome
-   paralysis and wasting of thenar eminence muscles and opponens pollicis (ape hand deformity)
-   sensory loss to palmar aspect of lateral (radial) 2 ½ fingers

  
**Damage at elbow**: as above plus:  
-   unable to pronate forearm
-   weak wrist flexion
-   ulnar deviation of wrist

  
[[Anterior interosseous nerve]] (branch of median nerve): 
-   leaves just below the elbow
-   results in loss of pronation of forearm and weakness of long flexors of thumb and index finger
