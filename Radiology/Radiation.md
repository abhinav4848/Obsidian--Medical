## Acute Radiation syndrome:
Law of Bergonie & Tribandeau: Whichever tissue has most undifferentiated cells, or cells in active mitosis, is affected first by radiation. 
*Blood > GIT > CNS/CVS*

| .       | Threshold | Cause of death                     |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Blood   | 1-2 Gy    | Infection & hemorrhage             |
| GIT     | 6-10 Gy   | Within 2 weeks                     |
| CNS/CVS | 20 Gy     | Circulatory collapse/Increased ICT |


## 10 day rule
Applies to reproductive age women: All elective X-Rays should be done only in first 10 days of menstrual cycle.

## Electron
A K-shell electron is a bound electron, and a free ekectron has zero energy. To make this bound K-shell electron go free, 70eV energy was provided. Let original energy of electron be x, and giving it 70eV made the energy of electron go to zero. So this x energy of electron was: `x+70 = 0`. So, `x = -70eV`.

Similarly,

| shell | charge |
| ----- | ------ |
| K     | -70eV  |
| L     | -12eV  |
| M     | -2eV   |

When outer shell electron jumps to inner shell, it releases energy equal to the difference in shells.

## X-Ray tube
Cathode (-ve) is tungsten: heats up and releases electron by thermionic emission. These electron accelerate to anode.

Anode (+ve) is alloy of tungsten & Rhenium.
Mammogram uses Molybdenum instead.

X-Ray produced when electrons hit anode. 

## Production of X-Ray in Anode
### Continuous spectrum
When travelling electron passes between anode electrons & protons, it loses energy variably and decelerates + deviates. This lost energy appears as x-rays all along the spectrum. 

### Characteristic spectrum
When travelling electron hits anode electron, it throws out inner shell electron and an outer shell electron jumps down. This energy loss appears as characteristic x-ray intensities on the graph. 
Used in Mammogram.

## X-Ray interaction with matter
### Comptom effect
Common. 
Mid-energy phenomenon.
X-Ray photon hits outer shell electrons - requires small energy.
X-ray beam deviated from original path due to collision.
Causes distortion: Scatter radiation.
Minimise by using high energy X-Rays

### Photoelectric effect
Common.
Low-energy phenomenon.
X-Ray photon hits inner shell electrons.
X-ray beam gives all energy to this electron and disappears: no scattering.
Maximise PE effect by relatively low energy levels, or make the target of high atomic number.

### Coherent/Classical scattering
X-ray beam gives all energy to this electron and disappears.
The electron vibrates and gives off identical x-ray but in different direction.
No ionisation occurs. Only direction change.
If only one elctron involved: Thomson scattering.
If all electrons involved: Railey's scattering.

### Photo disintegration
Nucleus of an atom breaks: alpha particle/neutron produced.
Occurs only if high energy involved: 7MeV.
This energy not used in clinic.

### Pair production
X-ray photon hits nucleus and photon converts into positron and electron. 
Incident x-ray beam strength should be > 1MeV. 
This energy not used in clinic.

## Exposure Factors
### kVp (kilo volt peak):
Tube potential/Tube potential difference
**Affects**:
-	X-ray beam penetration (*directly*)
	-	Low kVp: Low penetration
	-	High kVp: High penetration
-	Image contrast (*inversely*)
	-	Low kVp: increased contrast
	-	High kVp: decreased contrast

### mAs (milli Ampere second)
Electric current passed through cathode filament.
Determines film blackening.
Determines total no. of photons in x-ray beam.

**Affects**:
Radiographic image by determining the image contrast (*directly*)
-	Low mass: Low contrast
-	High mass: High contrast
