# CT Scan
Computed
Tomography: A modality which gives cross sectional imaging.

Invented by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield
Invented the 1st gen CT scanner/EMI Scanner.
Hounsfield unit scale (Hu scale/CT value scale).
Nobel award along with Alan Cormack in 1979.

## CT Parts
### Room
Wall is 1/16th inch thick lead lined, or 4-6inch concrete lined.
Glass window to look into the room is also lead lined.

### Machine
Table: to lie the patient down on.
Gantry: the circular machine inside which X-Ray machine is.

## Mechanism
**Principle**: The internal structure of an object can be reconstructed from multiple projections of that obhject.

The patient lies on the table and table slides into the bore of CT scan machine. 

The gantry has an X-ray tube on one side and detectors on the other side. The X-ray tube produces X-ray beam which passes through the patient's body and creates a radiographic image. It is detected and captured by detectors. The electronic data collected by these detectors is called *first projection*. The first projection is then transmitted to a computer After running through mathematical algorithms and data processing, the image is created on the computer. 

The X-ray tube now moves to a new position. The detectors also moved to the diametrically opposite position. Another beam is passed and another image is created. It is called as the *second projection*. 

This process is repeated until N number of projection from different angles of the patient are obtained. Using this data from the N number of projections the computer creates a cross sectional image of the patient. 

## CT scan generations
### First generation
**aka:** Translate Rotate Scanner
Invented by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield. It has an X-ray tube and single detector, a pencil shaped X-ray beam is used. The X-ray beam is moved from one side of the body to another. 
1 translation gives rise to one projection. After every translatiion, the setup is rotated by a small angle and a new translation is done from the new position. Repeat till N number of projections are obtained. 

### Second generation
**aka:** Translate Rotate Scanner
Fan shaped X-ray beam is used. Therefore, the degree of translation required is less. Uses a single row of detectors. Faster than 1st gen.


### Third generation
**aka:** Rotate Rotate Scanner
Translation eliminated. 
Wide fan shaped X-ray is used. X-ray tube and detectors rotate. *Drawback*: instability of electronic detectors. 

### Fourth generation
**aka:** Rotate fixed scanner. 
A complete ring of detectors which are stationary. The only rotating structure is the X-ray tube. 

### Fifth generation
**aka:** Electron beam scanner. 
No moving component in this machine. Electron gun/emitter emits high velocity stream of electrons which strike a Tungsten target ring around the patient. This produces X-rays which transmit through the patient's body. Fastest machine device till date. Used for heart which beats fast. 

### Helical CT/Spiral CT
Problem associated with third and 4th generation scanners. Chance for short circuit from the high voltage cables to avoid this one rotation of allowed at a time and Cuba finished off. This had to be repeated several times for slice by slice acquisition. Rotation was made possible by the introduction of slip ring technology. Two rings were used. Which slipped over one another. Outer ring stationary High voltage cables were attached to it in a ring mobile X-ray tube mounted on it. The inner ring by a brush. Contractors. The table on which the patient is lying is moving at the same time X-ray tube is also rotating around the patients body, hence called spiral slash helical CT. Sophie Dee Cone shaped. A cone beam can acquire multiple slices in one cut. Fifteen 64128. Faster a coefficient possible.
